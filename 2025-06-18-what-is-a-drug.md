## 💊 What Exactly Is a Drug?

A **drug** is a substance that changes how your body works. It can:

- Treat a disease  
- Relieve pain  
- Prevent infection  
- Or even support body functions like digestion or sleep

✅ **Example:**  
Paracetamol (also called acetaminophen) helps bring down fever. That makes it a *drug*.

## 🧬 From Chemical to Cure: When Does a Chemical Become a Drug?

Not every chemical is a drug.  
To be called a *medicine*, a substance must:

1. **Have a clear effect on the body**  
2. **Be safe to use (at the right dose)**  
3. **Be tested and approved by authorities like FDA or DCGI**

✅ Salt is a chemical, but not a drug.  
✅ Paracetamol is a chemical **and** a drug.

## 🚫 Not All Drugs Are Medicines

The word “drug” is also used for **harmful or illegal substances**, like cocaine.  
But in pharmacy, we mean **medicinal drugs** — the kind that helps you heal, not harm.

🧠 **Important Tip:** The **dose** makes the difference.  
Even water can be harmful in large amounts, and even poison can be a drug in the right dose.
