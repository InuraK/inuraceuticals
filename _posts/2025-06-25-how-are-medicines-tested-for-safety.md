# 🧪 How Are Medicines Tested for Safety?

Before any medicine reaches your hands, it goes through a long and careful process to make sure it is **safe** and **effective**.  
Let’s explore, in simple steps, **how scientists test medicines before they’re approved**.

---

## ✅ 1. Lab Research (Preclinical Stage)

Every new medicine starts in a **laboratory**:

- 🧫 **Cell studies:** Scientists test the compound on cells to see how it works.
- 🐁 **Animal testing:** Small doses are tried on animals to check:
  - Is it **safe**?
  - Does it work as expected?

📌 *Goal:* Find out if it’s worth testing in humans.

## ✅ 2. Clinical Trials in Humans

If lab tests show promise, the medicine moves to **clinical trials** — tests in real people.  
These trials are done in **phases**:

### 📌 Phase 1 – Is it safe?
- Small group (20–100 healthy volunteers)
- Tests **safety** and **side effects**.

### 📌 Phase 2 – Does it work?
- Larger group (100–500 patients)
- Checks if the medicine **treats the disease**.

### 📌 Phase 3 – Is it better than current treatments?
- Big group (1,000–10,000 patients)
- Compares new medicine with existing ones.

## ✅ 3. Approval by Health Authorities

Once a medicine passes all trial phases, the company submits data to regulators like:

- **FDA** (USA)
- **DCGI** (India)
- **EMA** (Europe)

They review all the results and only approve if the medicine is **safe and effective**.

## ✅ 4. Monitoring After Launch

Even after approval, doctors and scientists keep checking:
- Any rare side effects?
- Any long-term issues?

This is called **pharmacovigilance**.

---

### ✨ **Why This Matters**

Every time you take a tablet, syrup, or injection, remember:
- It has been **tested for years**.
- It has gone through **strict safety checks**.
- Only a small number of medicines finally succeed after all these steps.

✅ **Safe medicines = healthier lives.**
